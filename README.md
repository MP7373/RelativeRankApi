## Relative Rank
The idea of this project is to have a global ranking that is based entirely off of the relative rankings of shows. It's based on the assumption that it is easier to say that you like one show more than another than it is to assign a number in the 1-10 range to a show. So it will use each users strictly enforced sequential lists to map global scores to shows. I haven't worked out the exact specifics yet but what i've mentioned is the general idea.
